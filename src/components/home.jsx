        Welcome to our Plant monitoring web application designed to help you take better care of your plants by providing
        real-time insights and controls for optimal growth. Whether you're a seasoned gardener or just getting started with
        indoor or outdoor plants, our dashboard makes plant care a breeze.
      </p>
      <h2>Key Features:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-Time Data Visualization: Stay connected to your plants' well-being with live updates of essential environmental data. Our dashboard presents temperature, humidity, light levels, and soil moisture levels in visually appealing and easy-to-understand charts and graphs.</li>
        <li>Hardware Integration: Connect compatible sensors and actuators to your plants. Our dashboard supports a wide range of IoT devices and microcontrollers, making it easy to integrate your existing plant care setup.</li>
        <li>Real-Time Data Streaming: Once connected, our web application receives real-time data from your sensors, updating the dashboard with live information on temperature, humidity, and more.</li>
        <li>Ideal Plant Conditions: Not sure if your plant's environment is suitable? Our application compares real-time data with ideal plant conditions and alerts you if any parameters are outside the desired range, allowing you to take corrective action.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How It Works:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Live Sensor Data: On the "Live Sensor Data" page, our web application will continuously fetch real-time data from the Ubidots IoT platform, which is integrated into our web. The data will include information from various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, light levels, and soil moisture.</li>
        <li>Data Visualization: The fetched data will be beautifully visualized on the "Live Sensor Data" page through interactive charts and graphs. Users will be able to see the current values of each sensor in real-time. The dynamic charts will update automatically as new data is received.</li>
        <li>Comparison with Ideal Conditions: Simultaneously, your web application will compare the real-time sensor data with the predefined ideal conditions for each parameter. The ideal conditions represent the optimal range in which the plants thrive.</li>
        <li>Status Generation: Based on the comparison, your web application will generate a status for each sensor, indicating the health of the plants' environment. If the real-time sensor data falls within the ideal conditions, the status generated will be "MODERATE."</li>
        <li>Status Visualization: The "MODERATE" status will be prominently displayed on the "Live Sensor Data" page, giving users a quick visual indication that their plants are currently in good condition. This status will be shown next to each sensor parameter, such as temperature, humidity, etc.</li>
        <li>Alerts for Deviations: If any sensor data deviates from the ideal conditions (either too high or too low), the status will change accordingly, indicating that the environment requires attention. In such cases, the dashboard will also trigger alerts to notify users of the specific parameter that needs adjustment.</li>
        <li>Data Refresh Timer: To keep the sensor data up-to-date, our web application will include a data refresh timer. After every 2 minutes, the timer will trigger a new data fetch from the Ubidots cloud, providing the latest readings from all sensors.</li>
        <li>Automatic Update Alerts: Whenever new data is fetched and updated on the "Live Sensor Data" page, our web application will automatically notify the user of the changes. An update alert will be displayed, informing the user that there is a new reading from a specific sensor.</li>
        <li>Stay Informed in Real-Time: Thanks to the data refresh timer and automatic update alerts, users can stay informed about their plants' environment in real-time without manually refreshing the page.</li>
      </ol>
